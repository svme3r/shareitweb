    Title: "A SPOOKY NIGHT",
    Story: `I was travelling home from a birthday celebration at late hours. The radio suddenly started to produce static as I regularly rode down a block while listening to my favorite music.

      My car's engine also shut off shortly after the music ceased. I was now in the center of a mysterious place. 
      
      My gas tank appeared to be fine. I saw a woman in the distance as I stepped out of the car to investigate what was wrong with my engine. 
      
      Due to the darkness, I was unable to see her face….
      
      ….I walked up to her to ask if she might assist me in fixing my car. I heard a growl as I moved closer to her.
       
      
      A vicious-looking dog followed her and approached me while revealing his enormous teeth.
      
      I ran for my life as her dog jumped on me and attacked me. I hid in a tall bush I discovered a few streets away.
      
      I waited for the dog for seven minutes before giving up. Then I cautiously stepped out and started to walk away. Fortunately, the road seemed empty. Without a soul in sight, it didn't feel very comforting.
      
      The woman was nowhere to be found as I walked up to my car, which I could make out in the distance. She suddenly vanished. All of this terrified me too much.
      
       I was startled to see my car turning and heading in my direction. The only drawback was that the car was empty.
      
      
      As the car approached, the doors opened, welcoming me inside. I walked in without understanding what was going on and drove home….

    Title: "MY BIGGEST FEAR",
    Story: `I tried to face my biggest fear, which is of reptiles.

      I was always terrified of reptiles till one day...
      
      ...My family decided to visit my uncle in Maharashtra.
      
       My uncle from small has been the wild child in our family. 
      He is a daredevil who is not scared of anything and keeps reptiles as pets in the house.
      
      Even better, he has a facility where he can maintain several reptile species and practice training them.
      
      I was hesitant to inform him that I didn't like creepy crawlies when my family and I travelled there for a winter holiday.
      
      As soon as we arrived at their farmhouse, he greeted us outside while wearing a snake around his neck and arm.
      
      I had cold goosebumps throughout after seeing that. I couldn't help but wonder how he managed to handle a cold-blooded beast so effortlessly.
      
      I refrained from hugging him and pretended to be sick, so I hardly even gave him a handshake.
      
      After we settled in, he took us on tour, showing us all the reptiles he owned in the house. He was a hard nut to crack and made me face my fear by asking me to pet one of his docile snakes. 
      
      He told me to take a deep breath and that it was time to face my fears. I took a deep breath and put my hand out to touch it.
      
       As soon as I put my hand out to touch it, it felt cold, scaly, and different from what I had imagined it to feel like. 
      
      They were not all that bad to touch, and this was the start of a new beginning where, instantly, my perception and fear of reptiles went away, and I could face my fears.

    Title: "How I Found My Better Half",
    Story: `I thought I’d be alone forever after a terrible time in my life when there he was. 

      While I sat soaking in the fresh air after a two-week attack of bronchitis, he stood watching the waves roll in. He asked if he could sit next to me. “Sure, why not?” I said.
      
      We people-watched and talked about which cat breed was our favorite. 
      
      We watched the sunset together. I didn’t know it then, but I’d found my husband—or rather, he had found me. 
      
      We now return to that spot every year on our anniversary.
